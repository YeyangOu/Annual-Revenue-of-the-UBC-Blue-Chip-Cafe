# Annual-Revenue-of-the-UBC-Blue-Chip-Cafe

This is a mathematical modeling projects me and three other students from UBC worked on for a course. However, I had worked on the projects on my own and improved the models. In this project, we would construct a stochastic model to analyze how daily temperature and precipitation influence the daily revenue for the UBC Blue Chip Cafe.
